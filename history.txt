v0.1.1
----------------------
Removed filter registration for .avs and .vpy extensions. This preserves the ability to open scripts using the "AVI/WAV File Source" system filter. Better solution is to add ScriptSourceFilter as an external filter in MPC-BE, MPC-HC and other players, set the priority as preferred and enable the filter when needed.

v0.1.0.76 - 2020.06.16
----------------------
The first official release.
