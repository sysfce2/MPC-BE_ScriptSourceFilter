ScriptSourceFilter will not show a video with an error if it cannot connect to AviSynth+ or VapourSynth. This will allow the player to try other filters.

0.1.2.106 - 2022-01-05
-----------------------
Removed filter registration for .avs and .vpy extensions. This preserves the ability to open scripts using the "AVI/WAV File Source" system filter. Better solution is to add ScriptSourceFilter as an external filter in MPC-BE, MPC-HC and other players, set the priority as preferred and enable the filter when needed.
