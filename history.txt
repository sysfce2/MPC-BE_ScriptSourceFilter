The license has been changed to LGPL-2.1.
Added audio support for AviSynth+ and VapourSynth scripts.
ScriptSourceFilter will not show a video with an error if it cannot connect to AviSynth+ or VapourSynth. This will allow the player to try other filters.

Removed filter registration for .avs and .vpy extensions. This preserves the ability to open scripts using the "AVI/WAV File Source" system filter.
